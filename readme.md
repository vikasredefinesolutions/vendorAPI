### Environment Configuration

#### To configure the application, you need to create three environment files in the root directory of the project:

     .env: This file should contain the environment variables common to all environments (e.g., development, production). These variables will be used as the default unless overridden by environment-specific files.

     .env.development: This file is used for environment variables specific to the development environment. It will override any variables defined in the .env file when running the application in development mode.

     .env.production: This file is for environment variables specific to the production environment. It will override any variables defined in the .env file when running the application in production mode.

     .env.template: This file is template for environment variables that needs to be add in other env files. Please don't add any sensitive information in this file.
